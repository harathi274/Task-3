 Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

OVERVIEW:

This project collects and analyzes real-time COVID-19 data, including cases, recoveries, and fatalities. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**, it provides insights into trends, patterns, and correlations like the impact of vaccination rates and lockdown measures.

 FEATURES:

* Real-time COVID-19 data collection
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Statistical analysis with Pandas & NumPy
* Data visualization with Matplotlib
* Trend identification (cases, recoveries, fatalities)
* Correlation analysis (vaccinations, lockdowns, etc.)

 TECH STACK:

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**

 HOW TO RUN:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:

   ```bash
   python covid_analysis.py
   ```

 SAMPLE OUTPUT:

* Graphs of cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time
* Insights on the effect of vaccinations and lockdowns
* Trend visualizations for better understanding of the pandemic spread

 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

* Interactive dashboards with Plotly/Seaborn
* Machine learning models for prediction
* Country-specific insights
